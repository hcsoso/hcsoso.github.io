<dl>

<dt> Nov 9
<dd>
<ul class=top>
<li> We will set up a poll to schedule time for the final project presentation.  It will be on the week of Nov 22-26.
<li>
<a href="homeworks/hwC.pdf"><b>Homework γ</b></a> and <a href="homeworks/hwD.pdf"><b>Homework δ</b></a> are out, both due by 11/26 (Fri).
	<ul class=sub>
	<li>
	The deadlines for Homework α to δ are all moved to 11/26 (Fri), in line with the final project writeup deadline.  The deadline is firm because we need to submit the final grades in time.
	</ul>
</ul>

<dt> Oct 26
<dd>
<ul class=top>
<li>
<a href="homeworks/hw4.pdf"><b>Homework 4</b></a> is out, due by 11/8 (Mon).
<li>
Now all the project proposals can be found and downloaded in the Announcements section on <a href="https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/48419" target="_blank">Canvas</a>.
</ul>

<dt> Oct 20
<dd> <a href="homeworks/hwB.pdf"><b>Homework β</b></a> is out, due by 11/15 (Mon).

<dt> Oct 12
<dd>
<ul class=top>
<li>
<a href="homeworks/hw3.pdf"><b>Homework 3</b></a> is out, due by 10/25 (Mon).
<li>
Details about the optinal final project is out; see the <a href="projects.html">Final Project</a> page for more details.
</ul>

<dt> Oct 5
<dd> <a href="homeworks/hwA.pdf"><b>Homework α</b></a> is out, due by 11/15 (Mon).  The deadline is firm so I'll have enough time to grade.
	<ul class=sub>
	<li>
	Since we are dropping half of homework set from the application part, each homework is roughly equivalent to half a project and the solution can get lengthy.  Please remember you are encouraged to use all the resources online and offline to learn and solve the problems.
	</ul>

<dt> Sep 30
<dd> The deadline of <a href="homeworks/hw2.pdf"><b>Homework 2</b></a> has been moved to 10/11, after feedback from the students.
	<ul class=sub>
	<li>
	We will still have weekly assignments, but you will have at least two weeks to work on each (and at least two office hours to discuss).
	<li>
	Homework set on linkages and foldings belongs to the application section, and thus have its deadline at the end of the term (say 11/15), same as the optional final project.
	<li>
	Speaking of project, the details will be out soon; stay tune!
	</ul>

<dt> Sep 27
<dd> <a href="homeworks/hw2.pdf"><b>Homework 2</b></a> is out, due by <s>10/4 (next Monday)</s>10/11.

<dt> Sep 21
<dd> <a href="homeworks/hw1.pdf"><b>Homework 1</b></a> is out, due by 9/27 (next Monday).
	<ul class=sub>
	<li>
	Starting from Homework 1 you may choose to work in a group <em>up to two people</em>.  See the Homework page for the submission rules.
	</ul>

<dt> Sep 13
<dd> <a href="homeworks/hw0.pdf"><b>Homework 0</b></a> is out, due by 9/20 (next Monday).  Please submit all your solutions to the homework problems through <a href="https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/48419" target="_blank">Canvas</a>.
	<ul class=sub>
	<li>
	Homework 0 is designed to make sure that you have the necessary background knowledge and skill for the course.  If you find the problems to be way too challenging beyond the realm of fun, come talk to me and we can figure out together if this is the right class for you at the moment.
	<li>
	Make sure to read all the policies regarding collaborations, submissions, and grading on the <a href="homeworks.html">homework page</a>.
	<li>
	Most importantly, have fun!  There is no reason to take an optional graduate-level course about shapes and donuts if you are not having fun.
	</ul>


<dt> Sep 3
<dd> Hello, welcome to COSC 249.09!  This is the webpage for the upcoming course on computational topology.  I'm still preparing for the course; please bear with me!  If you see any broken links please do let me know.
<ul class=sub>
<li> There will be a <em>Homework 0</em> coming up on the first day of the class.  The goal is to give everyone a sense of what background knowledge is assumed for the course.  Stay tuned!
</ul>
