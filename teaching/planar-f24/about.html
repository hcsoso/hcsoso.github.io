<h1>All about Planar Graphs</h1>

<h2 id="about"> About the course </h2>

<p>
Planar graphs are among the most well-studied graph classes since the beginning of graph theory
and algorithm design. Planar graphs can manifest in computational problems as networks,
meshes, or terrains that are geometric and low-dimension in nature, which unsurprisingly find
many applications in computer graphics, visualization, vehicle routing, and shape analysis.
This graduate-level seminar-style course is aimed to introduce a vast array of tools for planar
graphs, ranging from combinatorial to geometric to spectral to algorithmic and beyond. Naturally, due to the sheer amount of work and literature in the area, the topics covered in this class will be biased towards the interest and expertise of the instructor.
</p>


<h3> Course Objectives </h3>
The course serves as an opportunity for people interested in planar graphs and their applications
to learn about the various tools and techniques developped, both classical and recent.


<h3> Prerequisite </h3>
<p>
Students are assumed to have the math maturity to read and write proofs and establish basic
properties of newly encountered mathematical structures. Knowledge in graph theory (COSC
30 Discrete Math or Math 38 Graph Theory) and linear algebra (Math 22, Math 24 or COSC
70 or Instructor Permission) are required as prerequisite. Knowledge in algorithms (COSC 31
Algorithms) are strongly recommended.
</p>


<h3>Teaching Methods and Expectations</h3>

The class will mostly be lecture-based in a seminar style.  Every lecture will be given by one of the students,
presenting important ideas extracted from the reference papers after discussing with the instructor.  Another student
will be assigned to scribe for the lecture.  After the class, the presenter and the scribe are responsible to produce
the lecture notes.  We will occasionally have homework problems to complement the lectures. Every student is expected to
finish the reading assignment before the class, taking notes and contributing to discussion during the class, and
solidify the understanding of the material by solving the homework problems.

We will assign roles to each student (technician, historian, architect, etc.) so that you may pay attention to part of
the material during the paper reading and provide help and comments during the lecture.  And we will use the
presentation, scribe notes and homework submissions to determine if the students are actively engaging in learning.

<h2 id="textbook"> Textbook and References </h2>

<p>
There is no required textbooks. The class touches upon various topics in combinatorial topology,
graph minor theory, topological graph theory, graph drawing, spectral graph theory, and graph
algorithms; many topics are based on currect active research in the field. As a result, there isn’t
any single textbook or lecture note that covers all the materials we will be talking about. (In fact,
the instructor is hoping to write high-quality lecture notes that can be used by future students
and researchers.) Relevant reading materials will be linked on the course webpage each week;
the instructor can provide additional references upon request.
