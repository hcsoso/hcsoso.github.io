<dt> Sep 21
<dd> 
I am very sorry that I missed the 9am-10am office hour today.  Now I'm on Gather.Town; come if you want to join us!

<dt> Sep 14
<dd> 
<ul class=top>
<li>
We will have our first lecture today starting at 4pm.  The zoom link can be found <a href="https://dartmouth.zoom.us/j/98686454390" target="_blank">here</a>.
To enter the meeting room you need a <em>passcode</em>, which I have attached in a separate Canvas announcement.
Some of you are currently outside of US and might have a hard time joining us during lecture hours.  Rest assure that there is no attendance requirements and all the lecture recordings will be uploaded and shared with you.  I will host an extra office hour for those of you who cannot join the one on Friday.  See you all soon!

<li>
The recording of today's lecture (and of all the future lectures) is up, and can be found on the <a href="schedule.html">Schedule</a> page.  If you experience problems watching the videos please let me know.  (Personally I recommend you to watch them in 1.5x speed as I tend to talk too slowly during live lectures.)

<li> 
An extra office hour will be held on Monday 9am to 10am (Eastern Time); hopefully this will cover the needs of those who are currently on the other side of the Earth.  Let me know if you would like to join the office hours but neither time works for you.
</ul>


<dt> Sep 9
<dd class=emph> <a href="homeworks/hw0.pdf"><b>Homework 0</b></a> is out, due by 9/18 (next Friday).  All the homeworks should be submitted through <a href="https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/43090" target="_blank">Canvas</a>.
<ul class=sub>
<li>
Homework 0 is designed to make sure that you have the necessary skills and math maturity for the course.  If you find the problems to be way too challenging beyond the realm of fun, come talk to me and we can figure out together if this is the right class for you.
<li>
Make sure to read all the policies regarding collaborations, submissions, and grading on the <a href="homeworks.html">homework page</a>.  
<li>
Most importantly, have fun!  There is no reason to take an optional graduate-level course if you are not having fun.
</ul>

<dd> If you are now in a different time zone other than the EDT, and in particular if you cannot make it to the lectures, <em>please let me know immediately</em>.  We will talk about the logistics of the course on the first day of lecture, and make a decision about the weights between synchronous/asynchronous components afterwards, but I do want to get the inputs from those of you who cannot join the lectures.


<dt> Sep 7
<dd> Hello, welcome to COSC 49.09!  This is the webpage for the upcoming course on computational topology.  I'm still preparing for the course; please bear with me!  If you see any broken links please do let me know.  A few announcements:
<ul class=sub>
<li> If you still want to enroll but cannot add yourself on Banner, please send a mail to me; I can remove the enrollment limit for you.
<li> We will (tentatively) be using <a href="https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/43090" target="_blank">Canvas</a> for discussions and homework submissions.  Due to unexpectedly large number of enrollments (woooo topology (click)?), we might need more tools to handle discussions and such.
<li> There will be a <em>Homework 0</em> coming up on the first day of the class.  The goal is to give everyone a sense of what background knowledge is assumed for the course.  Stay tuned!
</ul>
